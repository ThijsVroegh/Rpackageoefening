## Introduction

Working from home can be lonely. Do you miss the random chats at the coffee machine? Certainly we do!

Luckily, our R package `mysterycoffee` is here to help.

## How to use it

Well, first you'll have to attach the package.

```{r install}
library(Hgear)
```

Afterwards, the package will need the names of your colleagues. These are mine:

```{r names}
names <- c("Pablo RodrÃ­guez", 
           "Lieke de Boer", 
           "Barbara Vreede", 
           "President Obama", 
           "General Sun Tzu", 
           "Pharaoh Hatshepsut")
```

Now we just have to use the function `make_groups` to assign the random coffee partners:

```{r assign}
groups <- make_groups(names)
```

And here you have the result!

```{r print, echo=FALSE}
print(groups)
```
